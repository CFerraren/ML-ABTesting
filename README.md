## Bayesian Approach


* This is the approach that we will apply on this project


* Uses the past knowledge of similar tests or similar tests or similar data to obtain new information.

> The theorem helps in finding the probability of an event (A) given that a previous event has happened (B). 

     P(B/A) = (P(A/B)P(B)) / P(B)
     
     Where P(B) is prior probability
     
     

### Understanding A/B Testing:


- Also called as split testing


- Used to consider how small differences in a process can change customer behavior


- Make two version of a scenario, test them for user bahavior, declare winner


- Decide the metrics which influence your decision


- Use minimum versions at one time.




### Other Ways to do AB Testing:

1. Frequentist Approach - uses data from the current experiment and makes decision. Does not look at past data nor learns from it.

> Example: Hypothesis Testing - judging on p=values





### Why we used Bayesian Approach

- Uses a prior probability 


- gives a probability to represent degree of belief


- Calculates the probability of a hypothesis to be true and by how much.



### Use of Bayesian Approach

- Finding posterior results - making predictions on parameters given the observed data


- Comparing options - Finding which version of the model is better using the priors and probability generated by the posterior generated by the posterior (bayesian model averaging)
